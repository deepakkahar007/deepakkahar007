### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# A Self-Taught Developer

I am a skilled developer with a strong foundation in various programming languages and frameworks. Through self-directed learning, I have acquired proficiency in C, C++, Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python. My experience extends to working with popular frameworks such as Node.js/Express, FastAPI, Flask, Django, React, and Next.js.

I am dedicated to continuous professional development and am eager to contribute my skills to challenging projects.
